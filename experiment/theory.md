### THEORY: 

Basic Construction and Working of A DC machine: A dc generator is an electrical machine which converts mechanical energy into direct current electricity. This energy conversion is based on the principle of production of dynamically induced emf.

Construction of a DC Machine: A DC machine consists of two basic parts; stator and rotor. Basic constructional parts of a DC machine are described below. 
1. Yoke: The outer frame of a dc machine is called as yoke. It is made up of cast iron or steel. It not only provides mechanical strength to the whole assembly but also carries the magnetic flux produced by the field winding.
 2. Poles and pole shoes: Poles are joined to the yoke with the help of bolts or welding. They carry field winding and pole shoes are fastened to them. Pole shoes serve two purposes; 
 (i) they support field coils and
 (ii) spread out the flux in air gap uniformly. 
3. Field winding: They are usually made of copper, Field coils are former wound and placed on each pole and are connected in series. They are wound in such a way that, when energized, they form alternate North and South poles. 
4. Armature core: Armature core is the rotor of a dc machine. It is cylindrical in shape with slots to carry armature winding. The armature is built up of thin laminated circular steel disks 
for reducing eddy current losses. It may be provided with air ducts for the axial air flow for cooling purposes. Armature is keyed to the shaft.
 5. Armature winding: It is usually a former wound copper coil which rests in armature slots. The armature conductors are insulated from each other and also from the armature core. Armature winding can be wound by one of the two methods; lap winding or wave winding.
 6. Commutator and brushes: The function of a commutator, in a dc generator is to collect the current generated in armature conductors whereas, in case of a dc motor, commutator helps in providing current to the armature conductors. A commutator consists of a set of copper segments which are insulated from each other. The number of segments is equal to the number of armature coils. Brushes are usually made from carbon or graphite. They rest on commutator segments and slide on the segments when the commutator rotates keeping the physical contact to collect or supply the current. 
 
Basic Construction and Working of an Induction Machine the A.C. Induction Motor has three main parts, rotor, stator and enclose.

1.	Stator core: The stator is the stationary part of the motor’s electromagnetic circuit and is made up of thin metal sheets, called laminations. Laminations are used to reduce energy losses. 
2.	Stator Windings: Coils of insulated wire are inserted into slots of the stator core. When the assembled motor is in operation, the stator windings are connected directly to the power source.Each grouping of coils together with the steel core it surrounds becomes an electromagnet when current is applied.
3.	 Rotor: The rotor is the rotating part of the motor’s electromagnetic circuit. The most common type of rotor used in a three phase induction motor is a squirrel cage rotor. A squirrel cage rotor core is made by stacking thin steel laminations to form the conductor bars. After die casting, rotor conductor bars are mechanically and electrically connected with end rings. 
4.	Enclosure: The enclosure consists of a frame and two end bells (or bearing housings) the stator is mounted inside the frame. The rotor fits inside the stator with a slight air gap separating it from the stator. The enclosure protects the internal parts of the motor from water and other environmental elements.
5.	 Bearings and fan: Bearings mounted on the shaft, support the rotor and allow it to turn. Some motors use a fan also mounted on the rotor shaft to cool the motor when the shaft is rotating.


Construction of a Synchronous Machine
 Main parts of the alternator consist of stator and rotor. But, the unlike other machines, in most of the alternators, field exciters are rotating and the armature coil is stationary.
 1. Stator: Unlike in DC machine stator of an alternator is not meant to serve path for magnetic flux. Instead, the stator is used for holding armature winding. The stator core is made up of lamination of steel alloys or magnetic iron, to minimize the eddy current losses.

 2. Rotor: There are two types of rotor used in an AC generator / alternator      
(i) Salient and
(ii)  Cylindrical type

1.  Salient pole type: 
Salient pole type rotor is used in low and medium speed alternators. Construction of AC generator of salient pole type rotor is shown in the figure above. This type of rotor consists of large number of projected poles (called salient poles), bolted on magnetic wheel. These poles are also laminated to minimize the eddy current losses. Alternators featuring this type of rotor are large in diameters and short in axial length
2.    Cylindrical type: 
Cylindrical type rotors are used in high speed alternators, especially in turbo alternators. This type of rotor consists  of a smooth and solid steel cylinder having slots along its outer periphery. Field windings are placed in these slots. The DC supply is given to the rotor winding through the slip rings and brushes arrangement.
